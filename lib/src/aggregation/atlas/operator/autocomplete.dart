/// The `autocomplete` operator performs a search for a word or phrase that
/// contains a sequence of characters from an incomplete input string.
/// You can use the autocomplete operator with search-as-you-type applications
/// to predict words with increasing accuracy as characters are entered in your
/// application's search field. autocomplete returns results that contain
/// predicted words based on the tokenization strategy specified in the index
/// definition for autocompletion. The fields that you intend to query with the
/// autocomplete operator must be indexed with the How to Index Fields for
/// Autocompletion data type in the collection's index definition.
///
/// Example
///
/// Expected result:
/// ```
